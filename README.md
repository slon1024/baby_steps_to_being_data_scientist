# Baby Steps to Being Data Scientist
This presentation was preparing for the training [codepot 2015](http://codepot.pl)

The problem which was solved taken from kaggle.com: [Bike Sharing Demand](https://www.kaggle.com/c/bike-sharing-demand).

Note there're branches:
- step1
- step2
- step3

I recommend do one by one. Good luck!
